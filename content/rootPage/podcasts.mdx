Here's the podcasts that I listen to, in a rough order of preference:

## [Criminal](https://thisiscriminal.com)

Easily and [undeniably](https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/75ilo5/ive_spent_three_years_listening_to_podcasts/) one of the best podcasts out there. The stories it tells so beautifully, the production, the host's therapeutic voice and even the background score is absolutely spot on and will most definitely get you hooked in no time.

_"I'm Phoebe Judge, This is Criminal"_ gives me chills every single time.

## [Reply All](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all)

A podcast of the internet, for the internet, by some of the most talented talents in podcasting. There's a reason why they're so so popular.

## [Office Ladies](https://officeladies.com)

The Office is my all-time favorite sitcom, and though this one doesn't appeal to _everyone_, it certainly does to me. Hearing Pam and Angela absolutely nerding out about the show is just :chefskiss:

## [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org)

_Good design is more difficult to spot than bad design_; and this podcast is all about good (and sometimes bad) design in everyday life

## [What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law](https://trumpconlaw.com)

Donald Trump by any measure is a president who has made everyone question...well, a lot of things. Legendary podcast host Roman Mars breaks down US Constitutional Law with University of California, Davis, School of Law professor Elizabeth Joh; a beautiful amalgamation of great content, brilliant production and law

## [Syntax](https://syntax.fm)

I learnt React from Wes Bos' courses and he carries forward the same quality into this endeavour of his with Scott Tolinski as well. I love staying up-to-date with the latest in webdev and there's no better way than this. Plus, amazing sick-picks!

## [The Philip DeFranco Show](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-philip-defranco-show/id1278424954)

If you've guessed by now, I love keeping up with what's the latest in the world and there are very, very few outlets who provide the kind of in-depth and unbiased, no-BS news coverage like PhillyD. He's a veteran in his field, and rightfully so

## [Everything is Alive](https://www.radiotopia.fm/podcasts/everything-is-alive)

Definitely one of the more "different" podcasts out there; the host has conversations with personified inanimate everyday objects: newspaper, mirror, can of cola, etc. You really need to hear this one to understand what this is about!

## [Major Jobs Podcast](https://majorjobspod.weebly.com)

Reddit is to thank for this one, wherein the host interviews people from all walks of life about their usually-overlooked-and-yet-critical-to-our-society jobs

## [TheScore Esports](https://www.thescoreesports.com/home)

I have been a part of the CS community since ~2014 and followed the esports scene since around the 2018 ELEAGUE Boston Major; on some days there's nothing more inspirational than watching the content put out by this channel and I keep the podcasts close to my heart as well

## [This is Love](https://thisislovepodcast.com)

From the same crew that produces [Criminal](https://thisiscriminal.com), it's the same production and quality, but this time its stories of love

## [We are Netflix](https://jobs.netflix.com/podcast)

Netflix is definitely one of my dream=companies, and their podcasts dives deep into a lot of the behind-the-scenes in the company: culture, hiring, legal and licensing to name a few

## [Catch and Kill](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-catch-and-kill-podcast-with-ronan-farrow/id1487730212)

I'd never really heard of Ronan Farrow before this podcast and having to listened to this one, I see why he is oh so popular. What a class act of a person and journalist

## [The Joe Rogan Experience](http://podcasts.joerogan.net)

This is one of those where you just leave your brain behind and listen. There's a 50/50 chance you get scarred for life or you encounter a genuinely good episode (the one with Bernie Sanders!)

## [Chernobyl](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-chernobyl-podcast/id1459712981)

The podcast has the host interviewing the miniseries' creator (and write and executive producer) post each episode,discussing the true stories that shaped the scenes, themes and characters. The miniseries is one of the best I've ever seen ([here's a list of my recommended must-watch documentaries](/documentaries))

## [Undefined](https://undefined.fm)

One of my many sources of keeping up with what's going on with the tech world, the hosts are really good at bringing about conversations that are simply missing in similar podcasts

## [React Podcast](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm)

The OG, this podcast really dives into the React universe with really amazing guests
