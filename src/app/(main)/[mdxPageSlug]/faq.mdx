## What are those "plus sign keys" on your desk?

I'm so glad you asked! Those are different [switches](https://keyboard.university/100-courses/switches-101)
that I'd purchased to test out before buying my [custom mechanical keyboard](https://srtm.fyi/keeb). If you're interested, you can check them out (and order some for yourself!) on [Rectangles.store](https://rectangles.store) or [StacksKB](https://stackskb.com) ðŸ˜„

## What keyboard is that on your desk?

It's a custom mechanical keyboard you can find more details in [the tweet about it](https://srtm.fyi/keeb).

## Cool website! How'd you build it?

Thanks! You can check out the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/sreetamdas/sreetamdas.com).
