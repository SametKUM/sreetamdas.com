## VS Code Extensions

I believe that the tools and tooling that you use _does_ play a role in making you a more efficient programmer, and a couple of mostly quality-of-life extensions that I use with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) are:

- [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens) highlight the entire line wherever a diagnostic is generated and print the message inline.
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) Find out who to blame quickerâ€”spoiler, it's you.
- [Todo Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) search your workspace for comment tags like `TODO` and `FIXME`, and display them in a tree view. ðŸŒ³
- [Karma](/karma) Duh.
