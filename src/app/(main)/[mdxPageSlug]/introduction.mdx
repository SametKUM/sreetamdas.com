I'm a senior software tinkerer currently working at [Remote](https://remote.com). I enjoy working on React + TypeScript — lately, I've also been a fan of [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org). In the past I've worked with [Python](https://github.com/sreetamdas/streak-saviour) and dabbled with [C++](https://github.com/sreetamdas/2048) as well.

I love open source and try my best to contribute whenever I get a chance — I also do my (small) part by [open sourcing this website](https://github.com/sreetamdas/sreetamdas.com)! Additionally, I enjoy mechanical keyboards (check out my [keebs](/keebs)!) and [Counter-Strike][cs], and I could go on and on about either of them. :)

This website is my lil' labour of love, where I like to tinker around and absolutely over-engineer everything. Here's a non-exhaustive list of things that a simple-ish website like this does not need but I've had genuine fun building anyway:

- Page views with [Supabase][supabase] by calling a [Postgres function as an RPC](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/rpc)
- Syntax highlighting at build-time with [Shiki][shiki]
- Tunneled analytics and error monitoring using [Plausible][plausible] and [Sentry][sentry]
- Data fetching from [GitHub][github], [Notion][notion], [Buttondown][buttondown] etc. using [React Query][react-query]
- A [capture the flag](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)>) mini-game ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
