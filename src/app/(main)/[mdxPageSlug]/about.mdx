I'm a Senior software tinkerer currently working as a Senior Front-end Engineer at [Remote](https://remote.com). I enjoy working on React and all things JavaScript/TypeScript and am a big believer in the functional programming paradigmâ€”lately, I've been interested in learning [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org). In the past I've also worked with different languages like Python, JavaScript, Elixir, TypeScript and C++, as well as Node, Django and Redux.

I'm a self-taught developer with a degree in Metallurgy and Materials from [NIT Warangal](https://www.nitw.ac.in) _(psst, my alma mater's was the first major website I worked on!)_. I've been fascinated by computers and the internet from around 8th grade when I used Google for the first time.

In the past, I've worked extensively with Python and the Google Cloud Platform, and spearheaded Python pipeline _and_ React UI rewrites. I've continued working with React and TypeScript since then and love the experiece, along with a [bunch of other tooling](/tooling): I firmly believe in developer tooling which allows one to become a 1.1x developer. ðŸ˜‰

Outside of the world of programming, I am also a quizzer and was the lead at my college's [Quiz Club](https://www.facebook.com/qcnitw). Having played a lot of [CS](https://blog.counter-strike.net) in my childhood and college, I also love following the [CS:GO esports scene](https://www.hltv.org). I enjoy using mechanical keyboards and lurk [r/mk](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards) pretty much daily. I enjoy just about all genres of music and [podcasts](/podcasts) and am always looking for more ways to consume information from around the world. Additionally, I'm a [PADI certified](https://www.padi.com) scuba diver, equestrian and a pretty-decent cook.
